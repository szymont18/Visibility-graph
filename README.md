# Visibility-graph

The program solves the visibility graph problem. It involves finding the shortest path between points A and B, 
while avoiding obstacles encountered along the way.

You can find documentation in Polish in [dokumentacja](documentation.pdf) 
and quick graphic explanation of the problem in [presentation](presentation.pdf).

Also, we have prepared few examples how our project works. You can
find it in notebook [visibility_graph](visibility_graph.ipynb).
